    <p>Hope and Concern. Hope brings a lovable object onto the temporal horizon
    of the future; it is a feeling that responds to the possibility of attaining
    this object at some point. The counterpart to this feeling is concern. It brings a hateful object
    on the temporal horizon of the future, it is a feeling that takes place when
