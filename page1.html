    <p> According to Descartes,
        when good and evil are represented as something belonging to us, the
        consciousness of current good engenders happiness in us whereas the
        consciousness of current evil produces sadness. To use an expression
        by Spinoza, happiness is the passage of the spirit from a lesser to a
        greater perfection whereas sadness is the movement of the spirit from a
        greater to a lesser perfection.
