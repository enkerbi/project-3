        The fact that desire feels tension toward a possible object is grounded in the lack 
        of the object in the actual reality. The subjective emotion toward lack is lonesomeness. It is 
        self-evident that a human being so long as one exists as an individual, brings feelings that desire the 
        continuation of existing, as well as the lonesomness of individuality. We can say that the 
        individual is where desire and lonesomeness are. The life of lonesomeness is found 
        where an emanation of benevolence and a concentration of love breathe at the same time.
        How does desire develop? Once desire is fulfilled, tension relaxes and the 
        feeling of satisfaction arises. Satisfaction is a loose feeling of pleasure.

        I am silent, <br>
        Content<br>
        Being with another person-- <br>
        The breeze comes <br>
        And scatters the pine needles. <br>
