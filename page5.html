            When the feeling of love is deep, the emotion of dependence is liable to <br>
            take place. As the taste of love, the sweetness of this dependence seems to <br>
            stand in opposition to the bitter taste of hatred. Once we move to the other side of <br>
            hatread, when the character of the object of hate is smaller than self, the emotion <br>
            of contempt occurs. <br>
