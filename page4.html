        There are feelings that are objective and subjective. These feelings takes their main content <br>
        the intentionality toward their objects. <br>
        If the object engenders happiness in us, we feel love for that object; <br>
        if the object brings sadness to us, we feel hatred for that object. <br>
        To borrow Spinoza's words, love is happiness accompanying the concept <br>
        of external cause. On the whole, happiness and love are deeply connected <br>
        even at a sematic level: The Japanese word "ureshi" (happy) comes from a <br>
        transformation of "uruwashi" (lovely), and "uruwashi" is nothing but "heart's love" <br>
        (ura-hashi).

        love follows: <br>
        He looks art me, <br>
        Both arms <br>
        Stretched out <br>
        How lovely this child! <br>

    </p>

    <p>
        hate is: <br>
        I no longer hate <br>
        The knowledge that good things <br>
        In this world <br>
        Are few indeed <br>
        This is my habit of forgetting! <br>
